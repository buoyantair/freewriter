    <h4>What is freewriting?</h4>

    <p>A good description from <a href="https://theconsciouslife.com/liberate-your-mind-with-free-writing.htm" target="_blank">The Conscious Life</a>:</p>
    <div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; padding:20px; font-size:20px; margin-bottom:30px;">  <p>In freewriting, instead of forcing yourself to write, you simply ride on the waves of your thoughts and feelings and let them flow out of you without the slightest resistance. You move your hands quickly and continuously across the medium of your choice, without worrying about spelling, grammar, or style.<br/><br/>

      Rather than keeping your emotions and thoughts inside, you release them through writing, one word at a time, without the self-censorship that we often do without knowing. You hush your inner critic and take a break from having to be perfect.<br/><br/>

      At first, you may find yourself scribbling gibberish. That is perfectly fine. Just go with the flow and transcribe the content of your mind. You will be surprised that unconscious thoughts and insights will slowly take shape, and answers to your problems can often be found in your own words.</p>

    <p>It was popularized by Julia Cameron in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Way-Julia-Cameron/dp/1585421464/" target="_blank">The Artist’s Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity</a> as the essential tool to get past our fears, unblock our creativity and turn our dreams into reality. She named it <a href="http://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/" target="_blank"><strong>the morning pages</strong></a> and they are, as she puts it, “three pages of whatever crosses your mind”.<br/><br/>

        Buster Benson of 750words.com says it is <a href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/better-than-meditation-12532d29f6cd" target="_blank"><strong>better than meditation</strong></a>.<br/><br/>

        Tim Ferris describes it as the <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/01/15/morning-pages/" target="_blank"><strong>most cost-effective therapy</strong></a> he ever found while quoting Julia Cameron:

    <div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; padding:20px; font-size:20px; margin-bottom:30px;">  <p style="margin-bottom:0;">“Once we get those muddy, maddening, confusing thoughts [nebulous worries, jitters, and preoccupations] on the page, we face our day with clearer eyes”.</p></div>
    <h4>Why doesn't Freewrite save what I write?</h4>
    <p><strong>First, the process matters more than the product.</strong> Freewriting is about the process of writing, gaining insight and exploring ones creativity. It is not about the mass of words that it ends up producing, which mostly tends to be gibberish anyways. Good ideas always resurface stronger and the meaningless "stuff" we once may have thought to be important falls away. Let it go.<br/><br/>
    <strong>Secondly, to ensure complete privacy for your thoughts.</strong> Not saving what you write in a database somewhere, gives you the peace of mind required to know that what you write will never be read by someone else. Knowing that it is a completely safe space for your thoughts will get you better results.<br/><br/>
    <strong>However, you do have the option</strong> of saving as a .txt file or copy to clipboard to save it wherever you'd like. Protip: try writing about the urge to save everything instead.</p>

    <h4>What does it cost?</h4>

    <h4>Why isn't Freewrite free?</h4>
    <p>I will let this quote from <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/" target="_blank">Pinboard</a> answer (<a href="https://nomadlist.com/faq#free" target="_blank">idea credit</a>):</p>
    <div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; padding:20px; font-size:20px; margin-bottom:30px;"><p style="margin-bottom:5px;">Someone builds a cool, free product, it gets popular, and that popularity attracts a buyer. The new owner shuts the product down and the founders issue a glowing press release about how excited they are about synergies going forward. They are never heard from again.<br/><br/>

            Whether or not this is done in good faith, in practice this kind of 'exit event' is a pump-and-dump scheme. The very popularity that attracts a buyer also makes the project financially unsustainable. The owners cash out, the acquirer gets some good engineers, and the users get screwed.<br/><br/>

            To avoid this problem, avoid mom-and-pop projects that don't take your money! You might call this the anti-free-software movement.<br/><br/>

            <strong>If every additional user is putting money in the developers' pockets, then you're less likely to see the site disappear overnight.</strong> If every new user is costing the developers money, and the site is really taking off, then get ready to read about those synergies.<br/><br/>

            To illustrate, I have prepared this handy chart:<br/><br/>
          </p>
          <table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <th></th>
                <th> Free </th>
                <th> Paid</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Stagnant</strong></td>
                <td style="background:#fee">losing money</td>
                <td style="background:#efe">making money</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Growing</strong></td>
                <td style="background:#fcc">losing more money</td>
                <td style="background:#cfc">making more money</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Exploding</strong></td>
                <td style="background:#faa">losing lots of money</td>
                <td style="background:#afa">making lots of money</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p style="font-size:20px;">What if a little site you love doesn't have a business model? Yell at the developers! Explain that you are tired of good projects folding and are willing to pay cash American dollar to prevent that from happening. It doesn't take prohibitive per-user revenue to put a project in the black. It just requires a number greater than zero.<br/><br/>

            I love free software and could not have built my site without it. But free web services are not like free software. If your free software project suddenly gets popular, you gain resources: testers, developers and people willing to pitch in. If your free website takes off, you lose resources. Your time is spent firefighting and your money all goes to the nice people at Linode.<br/><br/>

            <strong>So stop getting caught off guard when your favorite project sells out! “They were getting so popular, why did they have to shut it down?” Because it's hard to resist a big payday when you are rapidly heading into debt. And because it's culturally acceptable to leave your user base high and dry if you get a good offer, citing self-inflicted financial hardship.<br/><br/>

              Like a service? Make them charge you or show you ads.</strong> If they won't do it, clone them and do it yourself. Soon you'll be the only game in town!</p></div>
